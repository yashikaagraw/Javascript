#### Undefined:- a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.
undefined == null => true 
undefined === null => false

NaN - Not a number. The Number. isNaN() method returns true if the value is NaN , and the type is a Number.

        Interviewer: What are the common breakpoints used in responsive web design?

Let's deep dive:
Media query breakpoints in CSS can vary based on the specific design and layout requirements of an application. Developers often define breakpoints based on the content and how they want it to adapt to different screen sizes.

Here are some commonly used breakpoints, but please note that these are general guidelines and can differ based on individual project needs:

1. Extra Small Devices (Phones):
  - @media (max-width: 576px) { ... }

2. Small Devices (Portrait Tablets, Landscape Phones):
  - @media (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 768px) { ... }

3. Medium Devices (Landscape Tablets, Small Laptops):
  - @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 992px) { ... }

4. Large Devices (Desktops, Laptops):
  - @media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1200px) { ... }

5. Extra Large Devices (Large Screens, TVs):
  - @media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }

These breakpoints are commonly used for responsive web design to adjust layout, typography, or other design elements to fit different screen sizes. However, they are not strict rules and can be adjusted or expanded upon depending on the specific needs of an application.

Developers might introduce additional breakpoints or customize existing ones to ensure that the application's interface is optimized and remains user-friendly across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. The breakpoints mentioned above are just a starting point, and their actual implementation can differ based on the design choices and the target audience of the application.
