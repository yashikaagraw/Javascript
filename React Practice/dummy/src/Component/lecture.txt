##Differece between state and props ?
Props is something that data receives and 
are used to pass data from parent component to child component,
while state is used to manage data within a component.
props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component,while
state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.
whenever there is state change, react component re rendered

##
inside react app we have SCAFFOLD, 
this create react app will build a dummy react app and then we can code inside it 
package will give us bundlers and then it will give us a set up of testing
and it will ready to go live application and it helps us to start developing very fast
we don't have to worry about packaging of the content.

## PACKAGING OF THE CONTENT:-
when we develop react application there are so many files, 
component, js files, css and everything so what happens is you can't 
directly host them on web so basically you need to run on the server
so we create a server so it helps us host those our application onto a 
server on local host and it will also help you to build.

## HOW IT WILL CREATE A BUILD:-
it basically uses sth known as bundlers, in create react app there is a bundler
which is known as webpack. it's job is to basically compile our code 
and basicallyit compiles our project and runs to local host and there 
are some commands by which you can build this project. 
all those things are done by blunder

## INSIDE PUBLIC FOLDER:-
have content which will need our application
i.e. icon of the app that can see on top of browser
manifest.js, we can put extra things 
PWS(Progressive web application)
ROBOTS.TXT:- will be helpful for SEO 
to make website crawlable for search engines
NODE MODULES:- 
is a place which has all the dependies of our project
when we create our project we need javascript packages
those js packages are installed inside this so basically 
it has a lot js libraries which are being used by react by webpack 
to make our application run.
i.e. helper packages which can be used inside 

##FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT:-
2 TYpes of functional component:-
class component:- 
functional component - normal js function
created using function inside javascript class based components are 

## JSX:-
JS is simply a scripting language, adding functionality into your website.
JSX is an addition to the JavaScript syntax which is a mixture of both HTML and JavaScript.
Both JS and JSX are interchangeable but JSX makes the code easier to understand for users.

## useState:- 
it is a hook to create some dynamic variables
if we want to change variable then we use 
React Hook that allows you to add state to 
a functional component. It returns an array 
with two values: the current state and a function 
to update it. 
The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument 
and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.

##Tailwind CSS:-
is a CSS framework it gives us pre-built classes
we can use them. it is good for large scale projects
where we have to write a lot of CSS  so it 
helps us to optimise css
