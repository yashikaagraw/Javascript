behind the scene when our code asynchronously then there are containers that are 
call-stack
call-back queue,
web API and 
micro task queue

WHEN TO USE NODE.js:-
Considering the main features of node.js and its strength, we can say 
data-driven, I/O- driven, event-driven and nonblocking applications benfit the best from a Mode.js
implementation.

It can be used to create :-
web servers

command line application 
creating applications
