 ▪ ex: 
 1.<Heading/> 
 2.<Heading></Heading>
 3.Heading()

✅ What is component composition?

✅ How to put any react element inside react component?
 ▪ we can do this inside {}
 
✅ what is XSS?
 ▪ XSS - Cross site scripting (XSS) is an attack in which an attacker injects malicious executable scripts   into the code of a trusted application or website. Attackers often initiate an XSS attack by sending a malicious link to a user and enticing the user to click it.
